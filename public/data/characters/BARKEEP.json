Was going well till we got bush wacked by terrorists, lost my machine in the defense, which would have been fine if they hadn't taken out one of the ships in my section. Apparently the kid to some noble muckety muck was aboard (without our knowledge) so everyone on security was fired, dumped at the nearest port and blacklisted from any future legitimate work. Currently attempting to track down the only enemy pilot (<strong>@Nebual</strong>) I got a scan of before having to bail out of my mech.</p>",
