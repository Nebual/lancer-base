She has spent the majority of her life in this facility and doesn't know much of what goes on out in the world beyond. Like many of the test subjects within the facility, she has undergone massive amounts of experimentation in hopes that she will become an NHP or vice versa, locking an NHP into a human body. They were definitely successful in leaving ghosts behind.</p><p>If it weren't for that train being derailed during a facility transfer, Elena would still be trapped by the Necro Corps NHP Testing Division. </p><p>Having never been a free person, Elena never had a mech or license to call her own.</p>",
